**ARCADE** 
  
The following games currently show the OSD when the core is loaded so they get blacklisted:  
```Astro Flash (Japan)
Fantasy Zone II - The Tears of Opa-Opa
Hang On Jr
Opa Opa (Rev A, unprotected)
Opa Opa
Riddle of Pythagoras (Japan)
Slap Shooter
Tetris (Japan, System E)
Transformer
```
  
This will hopefully improve in the future
