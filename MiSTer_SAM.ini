# -------- NOTES --------
# Arcade core will work on most systems using Update_All

# For Console cores make sure you are using the recommended folder structure: /media/fat/games/SNES/ etc.
# The script supports zipped Everdrive packs or unzipped folders.
# For PSX, MegaCD and Turbografx16 CD your games need to be in CHD format.

# -------- GENERAL OPTIONS --------

# Time before Super Attract Mode starts in seconds. On reboot it will wait an additional minute for all services to load up.
# SAM comes on at 60s + samtimeout, so default is a 2 mins wait in main menu before SAM starts.
# 300 = 5 minutes, 600 = 10 minutes, 900 = 15 minutes
samtimeout=60

# Time before going to the next core in seconds
gametimer=180

# Start SAM only from MiSTer main menu
menuonly="Yes"

# Which systems would you like to display in Attract Mode?
# Valid options: arcade atari2600 atari5200 atari7800 atarilynx c64 fds gb gbc gba genesis gg megacd neogeo nes s32x sms snes tgfx16 tgfx16cd psx

# When SAM starts, mute global Volume. Unmute when button is pushed.

# If "mute=Yes", what should happen when button is pushed?
# "Yes" - SAM will relaunch the current game with sound
# "No" - SAM will reboot to MiSTer Menu

# SAM game roulette is a mode available in the menu, where you only have a certain amount of time to play a game, before SAM shuffles to the next game.
# SAM will ignore any button inputs and shuffle to a new game after the set timer expires.
# While SAM is primarily meant as a way to enjoy the pixel art of random games, roulette mode let's you play those games while continuing to shuffle.

# Partial names with case insensitive spelling will suffice.

# -------- ADVANCED (HANDLE WITH CARE) --------
# When you push a button or move the mouse, interrupt SAM

# SAM tries to listen for controller buttons, mouse movement, mouse buttons, and keyboard input
# SAM attempts to detect newly added controllers and mice for monitoring
# Note: Not all devices will be recognized - notably BlisSTer controllers in LLAPI mode, some BT controllers and SNAC devices

# SAM creates game lists for each core this can be done all at once on your first startup
# create_all_gamelists="No" means gamelists will be created the first time a core is selected, as usual
# create_all_gamelists="Yes" means all the gamelists will be created the first time the script is run
# Future plans include adding options in the graphical menu to allow the user to create all of the gamelists
# in case roms are added removed, renamed, etc. Including one specifically for the Arcade cores, so you can
# update that list when new Arcade cores are added, without needing to regenerate the entire set
# these will also be available from the commandline, by running "MiSTer_SAM_on.sh ArcadeList" or, something similar.

create_all_gamelists="No"

# This option control when game lists will be regenerated automatically on startup
# Valid values are "Hour Day Week Always Never"
# Always will regenerate every time you start SAM
# Never will regenerate in a few hundred years :) So, not really never, but, close enough.
# Those without a connection to the Internet, and without an RTC addon will likely want to set these to Never
# and manually update.
# The rest are self explanatory
rebuild_freq="Week"
# This option is multiplied against the option above, so, a 2 would mean every 2 Hours Days or Weeks
# This is ignored for Always and Never, as you can only have 1 of those
# Valid values are any number higher than 0

# we assume you might want to update these more frequently
