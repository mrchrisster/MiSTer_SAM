# -------- NOTES --------
# Arcade core will work on most systems using Update_All

# For Console cores make sure you are using the recommended folder structure: /media/fat/Games/SNES/ etc.
# The script supports zipped Everdrive packs or unzipped folders.
# For PSX, MegaCD and Turbografx16 CD your games need to be in CHD format.

# -------- GENERAL OPTIONS --------

# Time before Super Attract Mode starts in seconds. On reboot it will wait an additional minute for all services to load up. So SAM comes on at 60s + samtimeout
# 300 = 5 minutes, 600 = 10 minutes, 900 = 15 minutes
samtimeout=120

# Time before going to the next core in seconds
gametimer=180

# Start SAM only from MiSTer main menu
menuonly="Yes"

# When SAM starts, mute global Volume. Unmute when button is pushed.
mute="No"

# If "mute=Yes", what should happen when button is pushed?
# playcurrentgame="Yes" - SAM will relaunch the current game with sound
# playcurrentgame="No" - SAM will reboot to MiSTer Menu
playcurrentgame="No"

# Which systems would you like to display in Attract Mode?
# Valid options: arcade fds gb gbc gba genesis gg megacd neogeo nes s32x sms snes tgfx16 tgfx16cd psx

# -------- ADVANCED (HANDLE WITH CARE) --------
# When you push a button or move the mouse, interrupt SAM

# SAM tries to listen for controller buttons, mouse movement, mouse buttons, and keyboard input
