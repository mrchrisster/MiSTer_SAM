# -------- NOTES --------
# Arcade core will work on most systems using Update_All

# For Console cores make sure you are using the recommended folder structure: /media/fat/games/SNES/ etc.
# The script supports zipped Everdrive packs or unzipped folders.
# For PSX, MegaCD and Turbografx16 CD your games need to be in CHD format.

# !!! Some settings will need a reboot to take effect !!!

# -------- GENERAL OPTIONS --------

# Time before Super Attract Mode starts in seconds. On reboot it will wait an additional minute for all services to load up.
# SAM comes on at 60s + samtimeout, so default is a 2 mins wait in main menu before SAM starts.
# 300 = 5 minutes, 600 = 10 minutes, 900 = 15 minutes
samtimeout=60

# Time before going to the next core in seconds
gametimer=180

# Start SAM only from MiSTer main menu
# If you change this to menuonly is set to "No", SAM will always start after you put down the controller. 
menuonly="Yes"

# Which systems would you like to display in Attract Mode?
# Valid options: amiga,ao486,arcade,atari2600,atari5200,atari7800,atarilynx,c64,fds,gb,gbc,gba,genesis,gg,megacd,n64,neogeo,nes,s32x,saturn,sgb,sms,snes,tgfx16,tgfx16cd,psx

# When SAM starts, mute global or core volume. Core volume can't be muted completely.
# A reboot or stopping SAM will clear all volume settings and restore any volume settings you have set prior
# Options are Global (Mute global volume) No (to always play game sounds) or Core (to mute cores individually). "Yes" can also be set which is the same as global. 
# Please use "core" for BGM support or use the menu to configure BGM automatically
mute="No"

# How do we exit SAM?
# "No" - SAM will reboot to MiSTer Menu when a button is pushed. 
# NOTE - If you push Start on your controller it will play the current game, any other button quits SAM. Set this up in SAM's menu under "Configure Exit behavior"
# "Yes" - SAM will stay in the current game when exiting.
playcurrentgame="Yes" 

# How to handle duplicate roms. Can be "normal" or "strict". Strict will only keep one version of a game (so no betas, hacks etc..)
dupe_mode="normal"

# ---------- SPECIAL MODES --------------
# SAM game roulette is a mode available in the menu, where you only have a certain amount of time to play a game, before SAM shuffles to the next game.
# SAM will ignore any button inputs and shuffle to a new game after the set timer expires.
# While SAM is primarily meant as a way to enjoy the pixel art of random games, roulette mode let's you play those games while continuing to shuffle.
roulettetimer="500"

# When pushing "next game" button on controller, do we want to ignore the current game from now on?
# Only works if controller has been configured in menu (or try default button "select")
ignore_when_skip="no"

# The Amigavision image contains demos and games. Here you can select what Amiga content you want SAM to show. Options are "Demos", "Games" or "All"
amigaselect="All"

# Good to use if you have young children. Limits rom selection to ESRB rated games with the "All Ages" label
# Please update SAM after enabling this to download the ESRB game whitelists
# Some cores like MegaCD will only have very few games so it's best to use coreweight which you can find further down in this ini
kids_safe="no"

# Some cores require a bios message to be skipped, eg FDS and Saturn. Try a value higher than 10
skiptime="10"

# Turn your MiSTer into a M82 NES unit - A kiosk display system for NES games that you'd find in a game store in the 80s and 90s.
# Edit /media/fat/Scripts/.MiSTer_SAM/SAM_Gamelists/m82_list.txt to customize the m82 list with your favorite games. The system has 12 slots.
# Set M82 gametimer (in secs) for how long you want games to be playable. Original M82 has settings for 30 seconds, 3 minutes (180 secs), 6 minutes (360 secs) and 128 minutes (7680 secs).
# If mute is set to yes, sound will only come on when a button is pushed to play the game

# -------- SAMVIDEO SETTINGS -------
