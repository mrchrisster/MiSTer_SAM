# -------- NOTES --------
# Arcade core will work on most systems using Update_All

# For Console cores make sure you are using the recommended folder structure: /media/fat/games/SNES/ etc.
# The script supports zipped Everdrive packs or unzipped folders.
# For PSX, MegaCD and Turbografx16 CD your games need to be in CHD format.

# -------- GENERAL OPTIONS --------

# Time before Super Attract Mode starts in seconds. On reboot it will wait an additional minute for all services to load up.
# SAM comes on at 60s + samtimeout, so default is a 2 mins wait in main menu before SAM starts.
# 300 = 5 minutes, 600 = 10 minutes, 900 = 15 minutes
samtimeout=60

# Time before going to the next core in seconds
gametimer=180

# Start SAM only from MiSTer main menu
# If you change this to menuonly is set to "No", SAM will always start after you put down the controller. 
menuonly="Yes"

# Which systems would you like to display in Attract Mode?
# Valid options: amiga,ao486,arcade,atari2600,atari5200,atari7800,atarilynx,c64,fds,gb,gbc,gba,genesis,gg,megacd,neogeo,nes,s32x,sms,snes,tgfx16,tgfx16cd,psx
corelist="amiga,ao486,arcade,atari2600,atari5200,atari7800,atarilynx,c64,fds,gb,gbc,gba,genesis,gg,megacd,neogeo,nes,s32x,sms,snes,tgfx16,tgfx16cd,psx"

# When SAM starts, mute global or core volume. Core volume can't be muted completely.
# A reboot or stopping SAM will clear all volume settings and restore any volume settings you have set prior
# Options are Global (Mute global volume) No (to always play game sounds) or Core (to mute cores individually). "Yes" can also be set which is the same as core. 
# Please use "core" for BGM support or use the menu to configure BGM automatically
mute="No"

# How do we exit SAM?
# "No" - SAM will reboot to MiSTer Menu when a button is pushed. 
# NOTE - If you push Start on your controller it will play the current game, any other button quits SAM. Set this up in SAM's menu under "Configure Exit behavior"
# "Yes" - SAM will stay in the current game when exiting.
playcurrentgame="No" 

# Good to use if you have young children. Limits rom selection to ESRB rated games with the "All Ages" label
# Please update SAM after enabling this to download the ESRB game whitelists
# Some cores like MegaCD will only have very few games so it's best to use coreweight which you can find further down in this ini
kids_safe="no"

# SAM game roulette is a mode available in the menu, where you only have a certain amount of time to play a game, before SAM shuffles to the next game.
# SAM will ignore any button inputs and shuffle to a new game after the set timer expires.
# While SAM is primarily meant as a way to enjoy the pixel art of random games, roulette mode let's you play those games while continuing to shuffle.
roulettetimer="500"

# The Amigavision image contains demos and games. Here you can select what Amiga content you want SAM to show. Options are "Demos", "Games" or "All"
amigaselect="All"

# Alternative way of selecting cores. Based on how many games a system has.
coreweight="No"

# --------- ARCADE ORIENTATION ---------
# Set Arcade orientation to "horizontal" "vertical" or leave empty

# --------- PATH FILTER ---------
# If you would like to only play games from a subdirectory of your games folder, put it here
# Partial match is all you need. Can be part of the path or filename.

# -------- TTY2OLED SETTINGS -------
# Options for https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_tty2oled - a Hardware Add-On display for MiSTer
# "Yes" shows the text name of the game being played
ttyenable="No"

# -------- BGM SETTINGS -------
# SAM supports BGM ( https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/MiSTer_BGM ). 
# It's best practice to set up BGM through the SAM menu (Select "Background Music Player")
bgm="No"
# Change bgmplay to no if songs play twice in BGM
bgmplay="Yes"
# Stop BGM when SAM stops
bgmstop="Yes"
# BGM playback tends to be louder than most cores. We can adjust bgm's volume here (value 1-7) 
# Once you play a game, global volume will be back to it's original level
# Note - bgmstop must be set to yes since bgm also does it's own volume management
# NOTE - This feature will write to the SD card on start and stop of SAM so by default it's off

# SAM will play every game on your system once before starting from the beginning. Change this to disable SAM's no repeat feature.

# -------- ADVANCED (HANDLE WITH CARE) --------

# -------- BUTTON DETECTION --------
# When you push a button or move the mouse, interrupt SAM

# SAM tries to listen for controller buttons, mouse movement, mouse buttons, and keyboard input
# SAM attempts to detect newly added controllers and mice for monitoring
# Note: Not all devices will be recognized - notably BlisSTer controllers in LLAPI mode, some BT controllers and SNAC devices
