# -------- NOTES --------
# Arcade core will work on most systems using Update_All

# For Console cores make sure you are using the recommended folder structure: /media/fat/games/SNES/ etc.
# The script supports zipped Everdrive packs or unzipped folders.
# For PSX, MegaCD and Turbografx16 CD your games need to be in CHD format.

# -------- GENERAL OPTIONS --------

# Time before Super_Attract_Mode starts in seconds. On reboot it will wait an additional minute for all services to load up.
# SAM comes on at 60s + samtimeout, so default is a 2 mins wait in main menu before SAM starts.
# 300 = 5 minutes, 600 = 10 minutes, 900 = 15 minutes
samtimeout=60
bootsleep=60

# Time before going to the next core in seconds
gametimer=180

# Start SAM only from MiSTer main menu
menuonly="Yes"

# Which systems would you like to display in Attract Mode?
# Valid options: amiga arcade atari2600 atari5200 atari7800 atarilynx c64 fds gameboy gbc gba genesis gamegear megacd neogeo nes s32x sms snes tgfx16 tgfx16cd psx

# Yes - When SAM starts, mute global Volume. Unmute when button is pushed.
# Core - Mute the core only (allows scripts like BGM to play over the attract mode)
# No - Don't mute anything
mute="Core"

# What should happen when button is pushed?
# "Yes" - SAM will relaunch the current game with sound
# "No" - SAM will reboot to MiSTer Menu
playcurrentgame="No"

# SAM game roulette is a mode available in the menu, where you only have a certain amount of time to play a game, before SAM shuffles to the next game.
# SAM will ignore any button inputs and shuffle to a new game after the set timer expires.
# While SAM is primarily meant as a way to enjoy the pixel art of random games, roulette mode let's you play those games while continuing to shuffle.
roulettetimer="500"

# -------- TTY2OLED SETTINGS -------
# Options for https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_tty2oled - a Hardware Add-On display for MiSTer
# "Yes" shows the text name of the game being played - NOT the standard core name graphic
ttyenable="Yes"

# -------- ADVANCED (HANDLE WITH CARE) --------
# When you push a button or move the mouse, interrupt SAM

# SAM tries to listen for controller buttons, mouse movement, mouse buttons, and keyboard input
# SAM attempts to detect newly added controllers and mice for monitoring
# Note: Not all devices will be recognized - notably BlisSTer controllers in LLAPI mode, some BT controllers and SNAC devices

listenmouse="Yes"
listenkeyboard="Yes"
listenjoy="Yes"

# SAM creates game lists for each core this can be done all at once on your first startup
# "No" means gamelists will be created the first time a core is selected, as usual
# "Yes" means all the gamelists will be created the first time the script is run
# Future plans include adding options in the graphical menu to allow the user to create all of the gamelists
# in case roms are added removed, renamed, etc. Including one specifically for the Arcade cores, so you can
# update that list when new Arcade cores are added, without needing to regenerate the entire set

create_all_gamelists="Yes"

# This option control when game lists will be regenerated automatically on startup
# Valid values are "Hour Day Week Always Never"
# Always will regenerate every time you start SAM
# Never will regenerate in a few hundred years :) So, not really never, but, close enough.
# Those without a connection to the Internet, and without an RTC addon will likely want to set these to Never
# and manually update.
rebuild_freq="Week"
# This option is multiplied against the option above, so, a 2 would mean every 2 Hours Days or Weeks
# This is ignored for Always and Never, as you can only have 1 of those
# Valid values are any number higher than 0
regen_duration=4

# -------- GAME PATHS --------
# Game path customization. Useful if you only want to show certain games in your collection or use alternative media storage like `/media/usb0`
# Uses the default rom locations that MiSTer and all cores use by default
# This allows you to have your roms in /media/usb0/games, for example, without needing to edit the paths, below.
usedefaultpaths="Yes"

# New experimental way of building the gamelists
# Yes to use the new way or No to use the old way
